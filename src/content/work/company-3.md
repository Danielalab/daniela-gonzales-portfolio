I lead the development of resilient, high-performance web applications. My work spans from directing Next.js migrations for performance-critical tools to building scalable TypeScript/React architectures from zero to one. I specialize in creating design systems (MUI) and state management patterns (React Query) that allow teams to move fast without breaking things. I’ve delivered core features for global streaming platforms and maintain a "quality-first" mindset with a baseline of 80% test coverage.
